SPIF - Streaming Progressive Image Format
=========================================

SPIF is a proof-of-concept image format that makes images look good on all screen resolutions.

SPIF is easy to use, it behaves just like a normal image.

The difference between SPIF and normal images is that SPIF looks good on Retina displays and loads fast on mobile browsers.


How SPIF works
--------------

A SPIF file contains several versions of the same image at different resolutions.

The SPIF viewer loads the version of the image that's closest to the displayed size.
