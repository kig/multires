<h1>SPIF - Streaming Progressive Image Format</h1>

<p>SPIF is a proof-of-concept image format that makes images look good on all screen resolutions.</p>

<p>SPIF is easy to use, it behaves like a normal image.</p>

<p>The difference between SPIF and normal images is that SPIF looks good on Retina displays and loads fast on mobile browsers.</p>

<h2>How SPIF works</h2>

<p>A SPIF file contains several versions of the same image at different resolutions.</p>

<p>The SPIF viewer loads the version of the image that's closest to the displayed size.</p>

<p>The SPIF viewer saves bandwidth by not loading the larger versions of the image.</p>

<h2>Tech details</h2>

<p>The SPIF format starts with a header that tells the offsets and sizes of the images in the SPIF.
The images are stored smallest first, but there are no image size restrictions apart from that.</p>

<p>For fast initial display, SPIFs should start with a small 32x32 thumbnail that fits in the same TCP packet with the header. That way you get an image on the first packet. After getting the initial image in, you can skip to realistic-size images.</p>

<h2>Problems to solve</h2>

<p>Browsers don't load SPIF images natively. This implementation is using JS to load and parse the SPIF files.</p>

<p>Browsers don't cache partial downloads. This can be worked around in JS implementations by using client-side storage.</p>

<p>This viewer loads all the smaller versions of the image on its way to the display resolution. This allows the viewer to get away with only one HTTP request per image. A bandwidth-optimal solution would load the SPIF header, then issue a HTTP Range request to load the wanted image version. A &lt;img srcset> or &lt;picture> -style solution lets you skip the header load (as it basically inlines the header in the HTML), but it's more trouble for web developers.</p>

<p>Downloading a higher resolution version of an image when you zoom into it is possible by hanging onto the header and doing a HTTP Range request for the high-res version. Not implemented yet.</p>


<h2>JS implementation issues</h2>

<p>Safari doesn't support Blob URLs as image sources, so on Safari the images are loaded using a data URL. On Chrome, the images are loaded using Blob URLs.</p>

<p>XMLHttpRequest with ArrayBuffer response type doesn't give you access to partially loaded data, so you can't stop loading early. As a workaround, this implementation uses responseText which is slower but gives you partial results.</p>

<p>Parsing the images in JavaScript is kinda slow, exacerbated by having to deal with responseText and data URLs. Not a problem on the desktop, but uses more power on mobiles.</p>
