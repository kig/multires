<h1>MultiRes - Multi-resolution image format</h1>

<p>Test it now! Zoom in to the photo on the left. You can use Ctrl/Cmd-+ to zoom in. Note how the GitHub banner gets pixelated but the photo stays sharp.

<p>MultiRes is an image format that makes images look good on all screen resolutions, from mobile displays to Retina displays.</p>

<p>When an image is zoomed out, MultiRes loads a smaller version of the image. When you zoom in to the image, MultiRes loads a larger version of the image.</p>

<h2>How MultiRes works</h2>

<p>MultiRes keeps each screen pixel filled with at least one image pixel, up to the maximum resolution of the image.</p>

<p>A MultiRes image directory contains several versions of the same image at different resolutions.</p>

<p>The MultiRes viewer loads the version of the image that's closest to the displayed size.</p>

<p>The MultiRes viewer saves bandwidth by not loading the other versions of the image.</p>

<h2>What happened to SPIF?</h2>

<p>You can still check out the <a href="spif/spif.html">SPIF image format prototype here</a>. SPIF is problematic because it requires HTTP Range requests to work well. It's also a lot more complicated to parse out images from a single file than it is to have a directory with a separate file for each image size.
